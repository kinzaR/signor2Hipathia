# signor2Hipathia
In this project we are aiming to integrate the pathways from signor db to be compatible for the hipathia method
# Future /possible enhancments:
- The use of "regulator_location" AN "target_location" to enhance the layout
- "mechanism" is ignored for the actual version, maybe has to be taken into account !
- "form complex" and "unknown" were removed comletly without any extra re-wiring or recovering ... maybe in next version removing that interaction by replacing with the nex node will be relevante for continuioty of maps
- proteinfamily and "fusion protein" were treated same , sep is ,
complexes  sep with/
- smallmolecule, chemical and mirna were keep with NA inm genesLists
- ,or, were replaced by a simpl ","
,and is /
Annotations from Uniprot to entrez:
-this protein (uniprot: A8MYZ6) has no entrez ID
-P0DP23  has more than 1 entrez gene id  801 805 808 , first one has been chosen!
-P0DOX3  has no entrez gene id, NA has been returned!
P0DOX8  has no entrez gene id, NA has been returned!
P0DOX6  has no entrez gene id, NA has been returned!
P0DOX8  has no entrez gene id, NA has been returned!
P0DOX7  has no entrez gene id, NA has been returned!
P0DOX6  has no entrez gene id, NA has been returned!
P0DOX3  has no entrez gene id, NA has been returned!
P0DOX7  has no entrez gene id, NA has been returned!

replace Mututes by joins 
-Stimuli : can I concider stimulus_as_out as phenotype?othercase will be circular !
