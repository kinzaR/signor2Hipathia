# signor2Hipathia
In this project we are aiming to integrate the pathways from signor db to be compatible for the hipathia method
# Future /possible enhancments:
- The use of "regulator_location" AN "target_location" to enhance the layout
- "mechanism" is ignored for the actual version, maybe has to be taken into account !
- "form complex" and "unknown" were removed comletly without any extra re-wiring or recovering ... maybe in next version removing that interaction by replacing with the nex node will be relevante for continuioty of maps
- proteinfamily and "fusion protein" were treated same , sep is ,
complexes  sep with/
- smallmolecule, chemical and mirna were keep with NA inm genesLists
- ,or, were replaced by a simpl ","
,and is /
-this protein (uniprot: A8MYZ6) has no entrez ID
